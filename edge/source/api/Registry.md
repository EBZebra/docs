#Registry


## Overview
The Registry API is used to write and delete registry settings, and create corresponding merge files.

## Enabling the API
In order to use this API you must include reference to the following JavaScript file that is included with the Enterprise Browser installation:

* elements.js 

> Note - this file either needs to be on the device in a relative folder from where your HTML page is, or it must be copied to your web server appropriately.

	:::html
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="elements.js"></script>;


### API Usage
This API does not use the `EB` namespace. It is simply referenced using the API name:

	:::javascript
	registry.delete();

>When the persistent tag is given the module will write a .reg file to the \Application folder on the device, which will add the setting to the registry when merged by Windows CE/WM, e.g. during a cold boot. When the persistent tag is given when deleting a setting, the module deletes any existing .reg file created above, and creates a new .reg file which will delete the setting when merged â€“ this is in addition to deleting the registry setting itself.
