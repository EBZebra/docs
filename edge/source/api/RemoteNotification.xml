    <MODULE name="Remotenotification" parent="Rho">
        <HELP_OVERVIEW>The Ring Scanner such as RS6000 provides several annunciators to notify the user of business application workflow events. The list of annunciators includes multi-color LEDs, a beeper and a vibrator. Remote Notification APIs enable the business applications to control these annunciators to notify the user of custom events in their workflow via Java script APIs. This API is supported only on Android platform.</HELP_OVERVIEW>
        <MORE_HELP>
## Enabling the API
To use this API, the following extension must be included in the `build.yml`:
    extensions: ["remotenotification"]

## JavaScript Usage
Be sure to review the [JavaScript API Usage](/guide/api_js) guide for important information about using this API in JavaScript

## Enabling the API

There are two methods of enabling the RemoteNotification API:

* Include all 'ebapi' modules
* Include only the API modules you need

Both methods are explained below. 

Either way, the included files will be found in: 
`/Enterprise Browser/JavaScript Files/Enterprise Browser`,
a directory on the computer that contains the Enterprise Browser installation.

### Include all JS API modules
To include all JavaScript APIs, copy the `ebapi-modules.js` file to a location accessible by your app's files and include the JavaScript modules file in your app. For instance, to include the modules file in your `index.html`, copy the file to the same directory as your index.html and add the following line to the HEAD section of your index.html file:

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi-modules.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&gt; This will define the EB class within the page. **Note that the path for this file is relative to the current page** (index.html). Any page on which the modules are required will need to have the required .js file(s) included in this fashion.

### Include only the modules you need
To include individual APIs, you must first include the `ebapi.js` in your HTML, and then the additional required API file(s). For instance, to use the Remote Notification API, add the following code to the HTML file(s). Again, this assumes that relevant API files have been copied to the same directory as the HTML.

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="eb.remotenotification.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&gt; In the code lines above, notice that `ebapi.js` is included first, followed by `eb.remotenotification.js`, which is the Remote Notification API for Enterprise Browser. **This coding is required on each HTML page whenever an individual API will be called from that page**.
