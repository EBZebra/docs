    <MODULE name="Camera" parent="Rho"  productException="">
        <HELP_OVERVIEW>The Camera API provides access to the device camera(s). Use this API to give users the ability to take a photo via one of the cameras and return it to the application. Photos can either be stored on the device as an image file or returned as a DataURI object for storage and/or display. Optionally, image files also can be transfered to online storage using the Network API.</HELP_OVERVIEW>
        <MORE_HELP>
## Enabling the API
To use this API, the following extension must be included in the `build.yml`:
    :::ruby
    extensions: ["mediacapture"]

## JavaScript Usage
Be sure to review the [JavaScript API Usage](/guide/api_js) guide for important information about using this API in JavaScript

## Ruby Usage
Be sure to review the [Ruby API Usage](/guide/api_ruby) guide for important information about using this API in Ruby

        <MORE_HELP_EB>
## Enabling the API

There are two methods of enabling the Camera API:

* Include all 'ebapi' modules
* Include only the API modules you need

Both methods are explained below. 

Either way, the included files will be found in: 
`/Enterprise Browser/JavaScript Files/Enterprise Browser`,
a directory on the computer that contains the Enterprise Browser installation.

### Include all JS API modules
To include all JavaScript APIs, copy the `ebapi-modules.js` file to a location accessible by your app's files and include the JavaScript modules file in your app. For instance, to include the modules file in your `index.html`, copy the file to the same directory as your index.html and add the following line to the HEAD section of your index.html file:

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi-modules.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&gt; This will define the EB class within the page. **Note that the path for this file is relative to the current page** (index.html). Any page on which the modules are required will need to have the required .js file(s) included in this fashion.

### Include only the modules you need
To include individual APIs, you must first include the `ebapi.js` in your HTML, and then the additional required API file(s). For instance, to use the Camera API, add the following code to the HTML file(s). Again, this assumes that relevant API files have been copied to the same directory as the HTML.

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="eb.camera.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&gt; In the code lines above, notice that `ebapi.js` is included first, followed by `eb.camera.js`, which is the Camera API for Enterprise Browser. **This coding is required on each HTML page whenever an individual API will be called from that page**.
