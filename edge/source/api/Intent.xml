        <HELP_OVERVIEW>The Intent API provides an inter-application broadcast message-passing framework.</HELP_OVERVIEW>
        <MORE_HELP>
## Enabling the API
This API is part of the `coreapi` extension that is included automatically.
    :::ruby
    extensions: ["coreapi"]

## JavaScript Usage
Be sure to review the [JavaScript API Usage](/guide/api_js) guide for important information about using this API in JavaScript.

## Ruby Usage
Be sure to review the [Ruby API Usage](/guide/api_ruby) guide for important information about using this API in Ruby.

         <MORE_HELP_EB>
## Enabling the API

There are two methods of enabling the Intent API:

* Include all 'ebapi' modules
* Include only the API modules you need

Both methods are explained below. 

Either way, the included files will be found in: 
`/Enterprise Browser/JavaScript Files/Enterprise Browser`,
a directory on the computer that contains the Enterprise Browser installation.

### Include all JS API modules
To include all JavaScript APIs, copy the `ebapi-modules.js` file to a location accessible by your app's files and include the JavaScript modules file in your app. For instance, to include the modules file in your `index.html`, copy the file to the same directory as your index.html and add the following line to the HEAD section of your index.html file:

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi-modules.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&gt; This will define the EB class within the page. **Note that the path for this file is relative to the current page** (index.html). Any page on which the modules are required will need to have the required .js file(s) included in this fashion.

### Include only the modules you need
To include individual APIs, you must first include the `ebapi.js` in your HTML, and then the additional required API file(s). For instance, to use the Intent API, add the following code to the HTML file(s). Again, this assumes that relevant API files have been copied to the same directory as the HTML.

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="eb.intent.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&gt; In the code lines above, notice that `ebapi.js` is included first, followed by `eb.intent.js`, which is the Intent API for Enterprise Browser. **This coding is required on each HTML page whenever an individual API will be called from that page**.

                <DESC>Sends an intent. The receiver of the intent can either be another RhoMobile  application that is listening for this Intent characteristic or on Android can be a native Android application setup with an Intent-Filter that will trigger based on the parameters of this method.

**Android Note**: On Android, the callback should be used only when the intentType is set to START_ACTIVITY. The only valid way for an Android app to pass a private file from a package directly to another application is to set the 'uri' parameter with content URI: 

Sample JavaScript:

    :::javascript
    var params = {
        intentType: Rho.Intent.START_ACTIVITY,
        action: "ACTION_VIEW",
        uri: "content://com.rhomobile.sample/rhodata/apps/public/sample.pdf"
    }
    Rho.Intent.send(params);

In most cases the extension of the exported file also must be added to the 'android:no_compression' list in the `build.yml:`


Sample Build.yml

    :::ruby
    android:
      no_compression: ['pdf','html','css']

For Android, this is similar to [Intent.putExtra()](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#putExtra(java.lang.String, java.lang.String\)). `data` should contain a HASH of Extra-String,Value pairs. The `Value` type of the `Extra` must be a string. Other object types are not supported at this time. For example:

`Android:`
    :::java
    intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, 'Here is the text I am passing to the Intent');

`JavaScript:`
    :::javascript
    var data = {"android.intent.extra.TEXT":"Here is the text I am passing to the Intent"}

Notice the use of the full constant string "android.intent.extra.TEXT" in place of [Intent.EXTRA_TEXT](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#EXTRA_TEXT)

For Android, this is how we have implemented [Android Intent Filters](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html#Receiving). In order to listen for Intents you will have to update the `AndroidManifest.erb` file and add a special section to it. This file is now generated with RhoMobile Version 4.1 when you create a new project. The file is located in the root of project.

Add the following snippet to AndroidManifest.erb within the `manifest` tags
<![CDATA[
    :::xml
    <receiver android:name='com.rho.intent.IntentReceiver'>
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED" />
      </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
]]>

Notice that this looks very similar to a standard AndroidManifest.XML file section except the `receiver` is the common RhoMobile intent receiver. The `intent-filter` tags within this section are standard AndroidManifest.XML notation that you would put in for the Intent-Filters that you want to listen for. Consult the [Android Docs](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html#Receiving) for more information about Intent Filters. From your Android application, you would use the [sendBroadcast() method](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#sendBroadcast(android.content.Intent\)) with the appropriate parameters for this filter.
