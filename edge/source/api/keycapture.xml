<API>
    <MODULE name="KeyCapture" parent="Rho" license="Required">
        <HELP_OVERVIEW>The KeyCapture module is used to intercept or override hardware keys. It is typically used to provide certain application functions through the use of the device's physical keyboard or other hardware enabled buttons.</HELP_OVERVIEW>

## Enabling the API
In order to use this API you must include the following extension in your `build.yml`
    :::ruby
    extensions: ["hardwarekeys"]

The `hardwarekeys` extension is also included automatically if you specify the following in your `build.yml`
    :::ruby
    app_type: "rhoelements"

> Note: If you are building a Windows Mobile or Windows CE app with this API, you must set your app_type as "rhoelements" in your build.yml as shown [here](../guide/build_config#other-build-time-settings).

## JavaScript Usage
Be sure to review the [JavaScript API Usage](/guide/api_js) guide for important information about using this API in JavaScript

## Ruby Usage
Be sure to review the [Ruby API Usage](/guide/api_ruby) guide for important information about using this API in Ruby

        <MORE_HELP_EB>
## Enabling the API
There are two methods of enabling the KeyCapture API:

* Include all ebapi modules or
* Include only the API modules you need

For either of these methods, you'll need to include files from the `/Enterprise Browser/JavaScript Files/Enterprise Browser` directory on the computer that you installed the Enterprise Browser.

### Include all JS API modules
To include all JS APIs, you must copy the ebapi-modules.js file to a location accessible by your app's files and include the JavaScript file in your app. For instance, to include the modules file in your index.html, with the file in the same directory as your index.html, you would add the following line to the &lt;head&gt; section of your index.html:

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi-modules.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

> Note: that the pathing for this file is relative to the current page.

This will define the EB class within the page. Any page you need to use the modules will need to have the .js file included in this fashion.

### Include only the modules you need
To include single APIs, you must first include the `ebapi.js` in your HTML as well as the API file you want to use. For instance, to use the KeyCapture API, I would add the following code to my HTML file(s), assuming the API files have been copied to the same directory as the HTML.

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="eb.keycapture.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

The ebapi.js file is necessary for all single API inclusions.

            <REMARK title="Keys which cannot be captured">
                <DESC>It is not possible to capture the following types of keys:

1.  Keyboard modifiers such as SHIFT, ALT, ORANGE button, BLUE button etc.
2.  Device Keys such as the screen backlight or keyboard backlight.
3.  Hot keys such as phone keys or 'soft' buttons, those whose function changes based on the running application.
4.  The Home key and the power key on Android and iOS devices.
5.  Depending on the device keyboard driver, some keys may not be easily capturable as they are interpreted as a shifted character by the device.  One example of such a key is the '#' character on CE7 devices, whilst the character code for this key is 23 it is interpreted as 33.  This applies to both capturing keys and specifying the HomeKeyValue.
6.  On Android devices, keys reserved for use by the "PTT" apps (such as the left trigger button), if a "PTT" app has been enabled.
7. On consumer Jelly Bean (Android) devices, the search button cannot be captured, as it has been reserved for the sole use of "Google Now".
8. On ET1, Search (P3) key is application specific. Dispatching this key within RhoElements wont do anything as it RhoElements doesn't do anything specific with this key (unlike the menu key which raises the menu).
Although on some device configurations pressing the SHIFT key twice generates CAPS LOCK which can be captured with a key value of 16.</DESC>

           <REMARK title="Capturing Function">
                <DESC>If you have enabled the function key in the configuration settings and that function key has some special behavior in the Operating system the key will not be capturable unless you also set the 'FunctionKeysCapturable' option (see RhoElements Configuration Settings). An example of special behavior is the F6 and F7 keys on the MC75a (non QWERTY) which control the volume up and volume down. Although 'FunctionKeysCapturable' will allow you to capture Function keys it will also disable the special Function key behavior. Which buttons map to which function keys will differ from device to device, some devices such as the MC9500 have dedicated, labeled function keys whereas other devices such as the MC75a do not label the fact that their volume / red phone / green phone keys all behave as function keys internally.</DESC>

            <REMARK title="Remapping a key to itself">
                <DESC>If a key is remapped to itself then RhoElements will appear to hang because if that key is pressed it will generate another press of the same key, and so on forever. The same will happen if for instance key 1 is remapped to key 2, which in turn is remapped to key 1.</DESC>

            <REMARK title="Symbol Keys">
                <DESC>On some devices certain keys containing special characters, these keys are known as symbol keys and they trigger two separate key events. This happens because such characters are translated by the platform into the combination of a Shift and a Base Key. Characters behaving in such way are $, %, &amp;, ", (, ), !, :, ?, #, _, @. Capturing symbol key input via the SIP is not possible on WM/CE as all symbol keys return the same value; there is no such limitation on the physical keys representing the special characters.</DESC>
            </REMARK>

            <REMARK title="Device Specific Exceptions">
                <DESC>Certain devices may map their function keys to apparently normal keys, for example the VC6090 maps the '{' key to F12 and the '}' key to F14. In order to capture those two keys it is necessary to enable F12 and F14 in the Configuration Settings. You may also find on some devices special keys like 'OK' return the same code as a function key, depending on your keyboard layout.  The MK3100 and other kiosk devices will report their symbol keys as '0' rather than assigning each key a different value.</DESC>

            <REMARK title="Use of Key Capture module on Localized Operating Systems">
                <DESC>Users of the key capture module with Chinese, Korean and Japanese operating systems should bear the following in mind: Internally the KeyCapture module stores key representations as VK codes, therefore the key event will always return VK_PROCESSKEY (229) and keys can not be individually specified. In JavaScript the DOM element's keyup event can be used as an indication of which key has been pressed.</DESC>
