#Enterprise Browser DOM Injection

## About DOM Injection

New in Enterprise Browser 1.3 is the ability to insert CSS, JavaScript and meta tags into the DOM without modifying the underlying application. This permits features, capabilities and even the look of one or more server-based Enterprise Browser app pages to be modified at runtime using DOM elements stored in a text file on the device. 

DOM injection is enabled by default in EB 1.3 and higher apps, and is **activated by  the &lt;CustomDOMElements&gt; in the &lt;Application&gt; section** of the app's `Config.xml` file. This new tag will contain a fully qualified path to the device-resident file that you create, which stores the DOM element(s) to be injected and the names of the pages to receive injections whenever displayed. **Injected CSS and JavaScript can be local, server-based or in any combination thereof**.

* **DOM injection device support**: 
	* **Android with stock webkit**
	* **Windows Mobile/CE with Zebra Webkit**
	* **Windows CE with IE engine**

**_DOM injection is NOT currently supported on Windows Mobile devices using the IE engine_**. 

No special licensing is required. 

## What is the DOM?
In the context of modern web programming, **the ‘DOM’ refers to your HTML5 code as it will appear when running**. For example, while the code of an HTML5 app might define certain variables, those variables contain no values until the app is executed. Therefore, it's accurate to think of the DOM as an HTML5 app that's in use.

## How to use DOM Injection

To use DOM injection, **all of the following must be true**:

* You're working with an Enterprise Browser 1.3 (or higher) app
* You've created a `tags` file containing elements to be injected and pushed it to the target device
* The path to the `tags` file is specified in `config.xml` 
* The target device is one of the following: 
	* Android with stock webkit 
	* Windows Mobile/CE device with Zebra Webkit
	* Windows CE with IE engine

**_DOM injection is NOT currently supported on Windows Mobile devices using the IE engine_**. 


### Step 1- Prepare the 'tags' file

* **Create a text file to contain the desired DOM-injection elements** using the tagging syntax below. This will become the list of elements that will be injected into the DOM, and will specify the pages to receive the injections. 

In the sample tag file below, notice a syntax similar to that of ordinary HTML tags for including scripts, style sheets and meta data. Parts of the tags as they apply to DOM injection are explained in the JavaScript comments, and in further detail below. 


	:::xml
	
	<!--FILENAME: 'mytags.txt' -->
	<!--DESC: 'tags' file for DOM Injection -->

	<!--JavaScript section-->

	<!--inject mytest.js into pages p1 and p2 only-->
	<script type='text/javascript' src='./mytest.js' pages='p1;p2'/>

	<!--inject mytest.js into all pages-->
	<script type='text/javascript' src='./mytest.js' pages='*'/>

	<!--inject a server-based JavaScript (into all pages)-->
	<script type='text/javascript' src='http://192.168.10.1:8081/test.js' pages='*'/>

	<!--inject a local JavaScript file (into p1 into p2)-->
	<script type='text/javascript' src='file://\programfiles\enterprisebrowser\rho\apps\app\test.js' pages='p1;p2'/>
	
	<!--MetaTags section-->

	<!--refresh pages p1 and p2 every 30 seconds-->
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30" pages='p1;p2'/> 

	<!--refresh all pages every 30 seconds-->
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30" pages='*'/>
	
	<!--enable the scanner on all pages-->
	<meta HTTP-Equiv="scanner" Content="Enable" pages='*'/>	
	
	<!--StyleSheets section-->

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css" pages='p1;p2'/>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css" pages='*'/>
	<!--link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css" pages='*'-->	
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="file://\programfiles\enterprisebrowser\rho\apps\app\mystyle.css" pages='p1;p2'>

Attributes of DOM Injection tags: 

**Note that the 'pages' attribute specifies the <u>file name</u> of the page into which the element defined in the tag will be injected**. The following rules apply: 

* Assumes an '.html' file extention; specify extension if different
* For local files, works from directory relative to the installation root; include qualified path if different 
* For server-based CSS or JavaScript files, works relative to the app's start page; include qualified URL if different
* Accepts wildcard (*) character to inject all files in relative or specified directory
* Accepts URLs for server-based JavaScript files only
* Meta tag data must be contained completely within the tags file  
* If using server-based JavaScript, see JavaScript Injection section (below) for dependancy cautions 

* When tags are completed, **store the tags file on the device** and make note of the path. 

### Step 2- Specify path to tags file in Config.xml

The tags file created in Step 1 must reside on the device. 

 * **Specify the path to the tags file** by adding a line like the one below in the <Application> section in the app's `Config.xml` file:  

		:::xml
		<Application>
		...
			<CustomDOMElements value="file://%INSTALLDIR%\rho\apps\app\mytags.txt"/>
		...
		</Application>


All runtime settings of Enterprise Browser apps are managed through the `Config.xml` file. For information about how to configure this file, please refer to the [Config.xml Reference Guide](#guide-configreference). The CustomDOMElements tag cannot be configured using the [on-device Config Editor utility](#guide-OndeviceConfig).  

> **This attribute's value is empty by default. DOM injection cannot function if this setting is blank**. 

## JavaScript Injection
Injection of JavaScript can be done either through file protocol or by using an absolute or server path relative to the Enterprise Browser app's start page. Different rules apply to injection of local and server-based JavaScript, and might affect the app if dependencies exist between the JavaScript modules in use. 

####Injecting local JavaScript
When using the file protocol, the JavaScript file(s) must be resident on the target device, and have path(s) specified in the src attribute of the script tag using the "file://" designation. For example, the following lines will inject four JavaScript files into all pages of the app-relative directory:

	:::xml
	<script type='text/javascript' src='file://\Program Files\EnterpriseBrowser\rho\apps\app\elements.js' pages='*' /> 

	<script type='text/javascript' src='file://\Program Files\EnterpriseBrowser\rho\apps\app\jquery.js' pages='*' /> 

	<script type='text/javascript' src='file://\Program Files\EnterpriseBrowser\rho\apps\app\jquery-1.11.3.js' pages='*' />

	<script type='text/javascript' src='file://\Program Files\EnterpriseBrowser\rho\apps\app\test.js' pages='*' />  

**Notes**
* Local JavaScript files are injected consecutively in the order in which they are listed in the tags file.
* Each JavaScript file will be loaded completely before the next file is loaded. 
* DOM injections occur every time a page is loaded. So changes to JavaScript files injected in this way can be put into effect simply by refreshing the relevant page.

> **Note: DOM injections occur every time a page is loaded. So changes to injected JavaScript files can be put into effect simply by refreshing the relevant page**.

####Injecting server-based JavaScript
* Here, the same four JavaScript files are injected from a server: 

		:::xml
		<script type='text/javascript' src='http:\\192.168.1.1:8081\elements.js' pages='*' /> 
		<script type='text/javascript' src='http:\\192.168.1.1:8081\jquery.js' pages='*' /> 
		<script type='text/javascript' src='http:\\192.168.1.1:8081\jquery-1.11.3.js' pages='*' />
		<script type='text/javascript' src='http:\\192.168.1.1:8081\test.js' pages='*' />  

With server-based injection, Enterprise Browser will be commanding the engine to inject JavaScript to the DOM asynchronously, which might cause jquery.js to be loaded before element.js, for example. Therefore, **if JavaScript files are interdependent, additional steps might be required to avoid failure due to a dependency issue**. 

In another example, the tags file below is used to inject the rhoapi-modules.js and test.js files into the page /dominjection/index.html. 


		:::xml
		<script type="text/javascript" src="./rhoapi-modules.js" pages="/dominjection/index.html" />

		<script type="text/javascript" src="./test.js" pages="/dominjection/index.html" />

If an attribute contained in the rhoapi-modules file--for example the Rho namespace--is required by test.js, an error might occur if test.js is injected first. To guard against this, it might be useful for test.js to include some logic like the JavaScript below to wait until its dependent JavaScript (rhoapi-modules.js) is loaded.

Sample JavaScript: 


		:::javascript
		(function() {
		   
		    // Poll for jQuery to come into existence
		    var checkReady = function(callback) {
		        if (window.Rho) {
		            callback(Rho);
		        }
		        else {
		            window.setTimeout(function() { checkReady(callback); }, 100); //check here
		        }
		    };
		    // Start polling...
		    checkReady(function(Rho) {
		      alert(Rho.Application.appName); //use rho api here
		    });
		})();
