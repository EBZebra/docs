# Enterprise Browser Shortcut Utility for Windows

## Shortcut Utility
Shortcut Utility is a Windows tool that quickly creates shortcuts for Enterprise Browser apps for Android and Windows Mobile/CE and can deploy them directly to devices. From a single screen, the tool can create and deploy multiple shortcuts, each with a unique name, startpage URL and Config.xml file, if desired. For Android, each shortcut also can have a unique icon. Shortcuts for different platforms can be created at one time and easily deployed en masse to their respective platforms using a Mobile Device Management (MDM) system. 

Shortcut Utility is included with Zebra Enterprise Browser 1.3. 

>**IMPORTANT: This tool relies on settings in the Config.xml**, a device-resident file that controls all runtime settings for Enterprise Browser. For help editing Config.xml files, please refer to the [Config Editor utility guide](../guide/ConfigEditor) and the [Config.xml Reference](../guide/configreference). 

### QUICK STEPS
1. Use these instructions only after [installing Enterprise Browser](../guide-setup) (version 1.3 is required). 
2. Open Shortcut Utility and **select a platform** (Android or Windows Mobile/CE).
3. **Select Default or Custom** Config.xml (if Custom, navigate to the file).
4. **Enter a name** for the shortcut.
5. **Specify a start page** URL.
6. **Select an icon** for your shortcut (Android only).
7. Click **Add to List** to store settings and create another, if desired. 
8. Click **Save Shortcut** to save all shortcut settings for later retrieval.
9. Click **Push to Device** to deploy (via ADB or ActiveSync).
10. **Launch Enterprise Browser** to create shortcut(s) on device.&#42;

&#42; *Shortcut creation behavior is determined by the **&lt;shortcut&gt; tag** in the Config.xml file on the target device. This tag must be configured prior to shortcut deployment*.

## Prerequisites
* **Windows development host**
* **Zebra Enterprise Browser 1.3**
* **USB driver for targeting Zebra devices**
* **Android Debug Bridge (if targeting Android devices)**
* **Microsoft ActiveSync (if targeting Windows Mobile/CE devices)**

EB Shortcut Utility is included with Zebra Enterprise Browser 1.3. If you don't already have EB 1.3, please [install Enterprise Browser](../guide/setup), then resume from here. 

## Using Shortcut Utility

* **Launch the "Shortcuts Utility"** from the Enterprise Browser folder of the Windows Start Menu, as below.

### Create shortcut(s)

1. **Select the platform** (Android or Windows Mobile/CE) to be targeted by the shortcut.
2. **Select Default or Custom** for the Config.xml to be used with the shortcut (selecting Custom will cause the Startpage field to change to a navigation box).
3. **Enter a name** for the shortcut.
4. **Specify a start page** URL (**or navigate to the Config.XML file** to be used if Custom was chosen in step 3). 
5. **Select an icon** for your shortcut (Android only). If left blank, the default Enterprise Browser shortcut icon will be used.
6. Click **Add to List** to store settings in the list at right.

After creating your first shortcut and adding it to the list, your screen should look something like this:   

![img](images/Utilities/Shortcut_Creator_03.jpg)

&#55;. **Repeat Steps 1-6** until all the desired shortcuts are created and added to the list.

&#56;. **Click Save Shortcut** button to save all shortcut settings to the development host for later retrieval and/or mass deployment. 

Shortcut data is stored in a file called `EBShortcuts.xml` in the path: 

`C:\EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles\EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles\EBShortcuts.xml` 

In the same location are custom folders named for each shortcut created, with that shortcut's Config.xml inside. For more information, see the Mass Deployment section, below. 

### Deployment (to single device)

1. After desired shortcuts have been created (using steps 1-8 above), **click Push to Device**. A screen similar the one below will appear. 
2. **Select the desired platform and click Deploy Shortcuts** to deploy through ADB (Android via USB) or ActiveSync (WM/CE via USB or Bluetooth). Shortcut(s) will be pushed to the device. 
3. **Launch Enterprise Browser** to create shortcut(s) on the device.

**Notes**

* **Shortcut(s) appear on the device _after_ Enterprise Browser is launched following deployment**.
* **Shortcuts are created _only_ if the &lt;ShortcutCreationEnabled&gt; tag value = 1 or 2**. See [Troubleshooting section](../guide/ShortcutCreator?Troubleshooting). 
* **Shortcuts are placed in the Home Screen on Android and in the Main Screen of WM/CE**. 

### Mass Deployment (via MDM)

Shortcuts can be packaged with an Enterprise Browser app (.apk or .cab) and the corresponding Config.xml file and easily deployed across an enterprise using a mobile device management (MDM) system. 

**IMPORTANT**:

* **Shortcut creation requires Enterprise Browser 1.3 (the latest) on the deployment PC and the device(s)**. The vast majority of installations will therefore require an upgrade. 
* **Upgrading overwrites the Config.xml on target device(s)**. Previous runtime settings should be replicated in the new Config.xml before deployment.
* **Shortcut creation behavior is controlled by settings in the Config.xml**. Be sure to read, understand and configure shortcut settings before deployment. 
* **Shortcut(s) must be deployed to an individual device before they can be deployed via MDM**. The instructions below cover this scenario. 

**To prepare an Enterprise Browser app for MDM deployment**: 

&#49;. **Deploy an app for Android (.apk) or Windows Mobile/CE (.cab)** using the [standard device deployment procedures](../guide/setup).

&#50;. **Copy the `Config.xml` file from the device to the host PC** and open it in a text editor. **Its location varies by platform**:

**Android**: `<internal storage>/Android/data/com.symbol.enterprisebrowser/`

**WM/CE**: `<internal storage>\Program Files\EnterpriseBrowser\Config\` 

&#51;. **Set the &lt;ShortcutCreationEnabled&gt; value to either 1 or 2**. For behavior of these options, refer to the [Troubleshooting section](../guide/ShortcutCreator?Troubleshooting) (below) or the [Config.xml reference](../guide/configreference). 

&#52;. **Push the `Config.xml` file to its original location on the device**, replacing the original.  

&#53;. If not done earlier, **create the desired shortcut(s) (using steps 1-8 above)**. Shortcut data is stored on the PC in a file called `EBShortcuts.xml` in the following path: 

`C:\EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles\EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles\EBShortcuts.xml` 

In the same location are custom folders named for each shortcut created, with that shortcut's Config.xml inside: 

![img](images/Utilities/Shortcut_Creator_07.jpg)

&#54;. To deploy shortcuts _**and**_ the Enterprise Browser app using an MDM system, **components <u>MUST</u> be deployed by the MDM in the following order**:

####MDM Deployment Order
 
a. **Deploy the desired .apk or .cab file to the device**.

b. **Unpackage the .apk or .cab file on the device**. This will generate the Enteprise Browser directory structure on the device and create a default Config.xml file.  

c. **Deploy Config.xml modified in step 3 <u>to its original location (as below) on the target device</u>** (replacing the default Config.xml file generated in step b). 

**Location of Config.xml file**:

*  **Android**: `<internal storage>/Android/data/com.symbol.enterprisebrowser/`
*  **WM/CE** `<internal storage>\Program Files\EnterpriseBrowser\Config\`

**<u>DO NOT deploy to removeable storage</u>**. 
 
d. **Copy directory structure (in the red box) to the target device**: 
 
* **Android**: `<internal storage>/EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles/` 

* **WM/CE**: `<internal storage>\Application\EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles\` 

**<u>DO NOT deploy to removeable storage</u>**. 
 
e. Launch Enterprise Browser on the device to create shortcut(s).
 
> **Note**: During deployment, it's possible that shortcut data for multiple platforms will be copied onto the given device (i.e. Android shortcut data on a Windows Mobile device, etc.). Shortcuts when generated will be platform-appropriate. 


<!-- &#55;. Shortcuts will be created on the device the next time Enteprise Browser is launched following deployment. **Optionally, launch Enterprise Browser from the MDM using one of the following commands**: 

Android: 

		:::term
		adb shell am start com.symbol.enterprisebrowser

Windows Mobile/CE: 

		:::term
		( ---> info to come <--- ) 
-->

Shortcut icons will be visible to the user in the device's main application area or menu. From a system perspective, shortcut files are stored this way: 

**Android** shortcut files are not exposed to the end user.

**Windows Mobile** `.lnk` files are deployed in the `\​Windows\StartMenu\Programs` directory and named after the shortcut. 

**Windows CE** `.lnk` files are deployed in `\​Windows\Programs` and `\​Windows\Desktop` directories  and named after the shortcut.

**Notes** 

* **File structure must be replicated exactly** for proper shortcut operation.
* **Shortcut files for all platforms (Android, WM, CE) are copied to the device**. 
* **When created on the device, shortcuts for other platforms are ignored**.
* Automatically generated shortcut **files and folders must not be modified by hand**. 
* **Customizing shortcut data files manually could result in unknown failures**.
* **To change shortcut settings, use the Shortcut Utility** and redeploy. 
* Existing **shortcuts on target device(s) will be overwritten** when redeployed. 

## Troubleshooting

Shortcut Utility communicates with Android devices via ADB (USB only) and with Windows Mobile/CE devices through Mobile Device Center (or ActiveSync on WinXP) over USB or Bluetooth. If you're seeing a message like the one below or having other communication-related issues, please **refer to the Connections section of the [Enterprise Browser installation guide](../guide-setup?Connections)**.

### Config.xml
If shortcuts are being deployed to the device but not showing up, **check the Config.xml to ensure that the &lt;ShortcutCreationEnabled&gt; tag has a value or 1 or 2**.  

 	:::xml

	<shortcut>
		<ShortcutCreationEnabled value = "1"/>
	</shortcut>


On-device shortcut creation is determined by this setting, and behavior thereafter depends which value is selected. Available options:  

* **0= create no shortcuts (default)**
* 1= check for and create new shortcuts at every launch
* 2= check for and create new shortcuts only at initial launch
