EB Shortcut Creator Utility for Windows 

EB Shortcut Creator is a Windows utility that quickly creates shortcuts for Enterprise Browser apps for Android and Windows Mobile/CE and can deploy them directly to devices. From a single screen, the tool can create and deploy multiple shortcuts, each with a unique name, startpage URL and Config.xml file, if desired. For Android, each shortcut also can have a unique icon. Shortcuts for different platforms can be created at one time and easily deployed to their respective platforms. 
Shortcut Creator is included with Zebra Enterprise Browser 1.3. 
QUICK STEPS for creating a shortcut
1. Select the platform (Android or Windows Mobile/CE)
2. Select Default or Custom Config.xml (if Custom, navigate to the file) 
3. Enter a name for your shortcut
4. Specify a start page URL
5. Select an icon for your shortcut (Android only)
6. Click Add to List to store settings and create another, if desired 
7. Click Save Shortcut button to save all shortcut settings for later retrieval
8. Click Push to Device to deploy (via ADB or ActiveSync) 
NOTE: Deployment behavior of Shortcut Creator is determined by the "shortcut" tag in the Config.xml file, and must be configured prior to deployment.  
------------------------- 
Prerequisites
Windows development host
Zebra Enterprise Browser 1.3
Microsoft ActiveSync (if targeting WIndows Mobile/CE devices)
Android Debug Bridge (if targeting Android devices)


EB Shortcut Creator is included with Zebra Enterprise Browser 1.3. If you don't already have EB 1.3, please install Enterprise Browser, then resume from here. 
Device Communication
For shortcut deployment, Shortcut Creator communicates with Android devices over USB using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), and with Windows Mobile/CE devices over USB or Bluetooth using Microsoft Active Sync. While the tool can be used to create and save shortcuts without a connected device, ADB and/or ActiveSync must be present on the development host for deployment. 
Using Shortcut Creator for Windows
Shortcut Creator can be a great time-saver when creating and deploying shortcuts one-at-a-time, but even it's more effective when used to create multiple shortcuts to deploy all at once. It even permits shortcuts for different platforms to be listed together and deployed separately. 
1. To begin, launch the "Shortcuts Utility" from the Enterprise Browser folder of the WIndows Start Menu, as below.

The Shortcut Creator window will appear, similar to the one below.

2. Select the platform (Android or Windows Mobile/CE) to be targeted by the current shortcut.
3. Select the Default or Custom Config.xml (selecting Custom will cause the Startpage field to change to a navigation box).
4. Enter a name for your shortcut.
5. Specify a start page URL (or navigate to the Config.XML file, if custom was chosen in step 3)
6. Select an icon for your shortcut (Android only).
If left blank, the default Enterprise Browser shortcut icon will be used. 
7. Click Add to List to store settings in the list at right. 

After creating your first shortcut and adding it to the list, your screen should look something like the one below:

8. Repeat Steps 2-7 until all the desired shortcuts are created and added to the list. 
9. Click Save Shortcut button to save all shortcut settings to the development host for later retrieval. Shortcut data is stored at the root level of the development in \EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles\EnterpriseBrowserShortcutFiles\EBShortcuts.xml. 
10. Click Push to Device. A screen similar the one below will appear. 
11. Select the desired platform and click Deploy Shortcuts to deploy via ADB or ActiveSync.

NOTE: After shortcut data is pushed to the device, shortcuts are created at the next Enterprise Browser launch. Shortcut creation thereafter depends on how the shortcut tag is configured in the Config.XML file. See options below. Whether deploying to Android or Windows Mobile/CE, the device must contain an Enterprise Browser app with a Config.xml file that includes the "shortcut" tag. The available options are as follows:  

 :::xml
<shortcut>
	<ShortcutCreationEnabled value = "1"/>
</shortcut>

Possible Values (0, 1, or 2)
0= create no shortcuts (default)
1= check for and create new shortcuts at every launch
2= check for and create new shortcuts at initial launch only

For shortcut deployment, Shortcut Creator communicates with Android devices over USB using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). To ensure that ADB is installed and communicating with a device: 
Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the adb.exe utility.
Run the "adb devices" command. The screen below shows a failed communication attempt followed by a successful one. 
If your device fails, it might be necessary to install an OEM USB Driver.
