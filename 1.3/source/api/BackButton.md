# BackButton
## Overview
The BackButton Module is used to set the parameters of the Back Button. When clicked, the Back button will navigate to the previously loaded page, if any.

> Note: When using the backbutton on a VC5090 device, there is the possibility that the display will be slightly distorted while the backbutton is displayed. This only occurs when the backbutton or other similar overlays are on set to be visible.
Other overlays consist of, but are not necessarily limited to:
* addressBar
* keystate indicator
* forwardbutton
* gobutton
* minimizebutton
* quitbutton
* reloadButton
* sipbutton
* stopbutton

## Enabling the API
In order to use this API you must include reference to the following JavaScript file that is included with the Enterprise Browser installation:

* elements.js 

> Note - this file either needs to be on the device in a relative folder from where your HTML page is, or it must be copied to your web server appropriately.

	:::html
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="elements.js"></script>;

### API Usage
This API does not use the `EB` namespace. It is simply referenced using the API name:

	:::javascript
	backButton.visibility = 'visible';

## Examples
### Using the Back Button
In this example, you will see how to enable the back button as well as set many of its properties. This example assumes that the elements and ebapi-modules.js files reside in the same file as the html file invoking them.

> Note: The ebapi-modiles.js library here is only included because it is needed for the System API.

	:::html
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="elements.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi-modules.js"></script>

		<title>Back Button Example</title>

		<script>
		var visibility   = false;
		var screenWidth  = EB.System.realScreenWidth;
		var screenHeight = EB.System.realScreenHeight;

		function toggleBackButton(){
			print.innerHTML = visibility
			if(visibility){
				backButton.visibility = 'hidden';
				visibility = false;
			}
			else{
				showButton();
				visibility = true;
			}
		}

		function showButton(){
			backButton.width = 50;
			backButton.height = 50;
			// When aligning the icon with the right side, we need to account for the icon width.
			backButton.left = screenWidth - 50;
			// When aligning the icon with the bottom, we need to account for the icon height.
			backButton.top = screenHeight - 50;
			backButton.visibility = 'visible';
		}

		function hideBackButton(){
			backButton.visibility = 'hidden';
		}

		</script>
	</head>
	<body onunload='hideBackButton()'>
		<h1>BackButton API Example</h1>
		</br>
		</br>
		<div>
			<button onclick="toggleBackButton()">Toggle Back Button</button></br>
		</div>
	</body>

## Remarks
### Use of Images on Buttons.
Images can be specified as local to the device or on an HTTP / FTP server, just specify the required protocol as part of your URL (ex: file://\, HTTP:// ). Image will be scaled to the size of the button. JPEG and GIF images are only supported on WM devices. Both CE and WM support BMP files.

### Default Positions
By default this control will be placed a the top of the screen. On Windows Mobile if the ‘FullScreen’ configuration setting is disabled the control will need to be moved, otherwise it will appear beneath the task bar.

### Switching to Other Applications
All controls are designed to be shown on top of Enterprise Browser. If you require to switch to an application other than Enterprise Browser you should minimize Enterprise Browser to ensure the buttons do not remain shown. (Not applicable to Android)

### Screen Orientation
When the screen orientation changes, either using the ScreenOrientation tag or by rotating a device with hardware support, the command areas will automatically move and resize to fit the new layout. However the buttons themselves are not moved and in some cases this may result in them being off the screen or not in the expected position. If so they must be moved manually by detecting the ScreenOrientationEvent.

### Use in Production
This API is designed for debugging your application only and should not be used in production

### Internet Explorer (IE) Rendering Engine
When using the this feature on a CE device using the IE engine, screen distortion may be noticed when scrolling. This is due to a limitation of the IE engine and can be worked around by any of the following options:

* Not using debug buttons - If your app must use the IE engine, do not use debug buttons in the app.
* If you need to use the signal or battery indicators either:
	* Don't scroll the page.
	* Don't use the signal / battery indicators
	* Use the Webkit engine.
