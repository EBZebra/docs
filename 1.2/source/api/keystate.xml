        <HELP_OVERVIEW>The KeyState API is used to display small icons to the user indicating the current shifted state of the hardware keyboard. The KeyState indicator will display icons for Shift, Alt, Control, Function, Caps, Num lock and Orange key states, growing from the right as necessary if more than one key state is set at once.

> Note: When using the keyState indicator on a VC5090 device, there is the possibility that the display will be slightly distorted while the keyState indicator is displayed. This only occurs when the keyState indicator or other similar overlays are on set to be visible.
Other overlays consist of, but are not necessarily limited to:
* addressBar
* backbutton
* forwardbutton
* gobutton
* minimizebutton
* quitbutton
* reloadButton
* sipbutton
* stopbutton

## Enabling the API
In order to use this API you must include the following extension in your `build.yml`.
    :::ruby
    extensions: ["indicators"]

The `indicators` extension is also included automatically if you specify the following in your `build.yml`.
    :::ruby
    app_type: "rhoelements"

NOTE: If you are building a Windows Mobile or Windows CE app with this API, you must set your app_type as "rhoelements" in your build.yml as shown [here](../guide/build_config#other-build-time-settings).

## JavaScript Usage
Be sure to review the [JavaScript API Usage](/guide/api_js) guide for important information about using this API in JavaScript.

## Ruby Usage
Be sure to review the [Ruby API Usage](/guide/api_ruby) guide for important information about using this API in Ruby.

## Enabling the API
There are two methods of enabling the KeyState API: 

* Include all ebapi modules or 
* Include only the API modules you need 

For either of these methods, you'll need to include files from the `/Enterprise Browser/JavaScript Files/Enterprise Browser` directory on the computer that you installed the Enterprise Browser.

### Include all JS API modules
To include all JS APIs, you must copy the ebapi-modules.js file to a location accessible by your app's files and include the JavaScript file in your app. For instance, to include the modules file in your index.html, with the file in the same directory as your index.html, you would add the following line to the &lt;head&gt; section of your index.html:

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi-modules.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

> Note: that the pathing for this file is relative to the current page.

This will define the EB class within the page. Any page you need to use the modules will need to have the .js file included in this fashion.

### Include only the modules you need
To include single APIs, you must first include the `ebapi.js` in your HTML as well as the API file you want to use. For instance, to use the KeyState API, I would add the following code to my HTML file(s), assuming the API files have been copied to the same directory as the HTML.

    :::html
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="eb.keystate.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

The ebapi.js file is necessary for all single API inclusions.
