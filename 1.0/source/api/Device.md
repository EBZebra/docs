# Device
## Overview
The Device Module controls device functions like suspend and wake.

## Enabling the API
In order to use this API you must include reference to the following JavaScript file that is included with the Enterprise Browser installation:

* elements.js 

> Note - this file either needs to be on the device in a relative folder from where your HTML page is, or it must be copied to your web server appropriately.

	:::html
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="elements.js"></script>;
