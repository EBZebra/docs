# HomeButton
## Overview
The HomeButton Module is used to set the parameters of the Home Button. When the home button is clicked the Enterprise Browser will navigate to the start page as defined in the configuration.

## Enabling the API
In order to use this API you must include reference to the following JavaScript file that is included with the Enterprise Browser installation:

* elements.js 

> Note - this file either needs to be on the device in a relative folder from where your HTML page is, or it must be copied to your web server appropriately.

	:::html
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="elements.js"></script>;

### API Usage
This API does not use the `EB` namespace. It is simply referenced using the API name:

	:::javascript
	homeButton.visibility = 'visible';

## Remarks
### Use of Images on Buttons.
Images can be specified as local to the device or on an HTTP / FTP server, just specify the required protocol as part of your URL (ex: file://\, HTTP:// ). Image will be scaled to the size of the button. JPEG and GIF images are only supported on WM devices. Both CE and WM support BMP files.

### Default Positions
By default this control will be placed a the top of the screen. On Windows Mobile if the ‘FullScreen’ configuration setting is disabled the control will need to be moved, otherwise it will appear beneath the task bar.

### Switching to Other Applications
All controls are designed to be shown on top of Enterprise Browser. If you require to switch to an application other than Enterprise Browser you should minimize Enterprise Browser to ensure the buttons do not remain shown. (Not applicable to Android).

### Screen Orientation
When the screen orientation changes, either using the ScreenOrientation tag or by rotating a device with hardware support, the command areas will automatically move and resize to fit the new layout. However the buttons themselves are not moved and in some cases this may result in them being off the screen or not in the expected position. If so they must be moved manually by detecting the ScreenOrientationEvent.

### Use in Production
This API is designed for debugging your application only and should not be used in production.
