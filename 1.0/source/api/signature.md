#Signature


## Overview
creates a rectangular box within which the user can draw by using a finger or the device's stylus to record handwritten data. Common usages for this tag include the capture of client/customer signatures and the input of handwritten text/notations.
## Enabling the API
There are two methods of enabling the Signature API: 

* Include all ebapi modules or 
* Include only the API modules you need 

For either of these methods, you'll need to include files from the `/Enterprise Browser/JavaScript Files/Enterprise Browser` directory on the computer that you installed the Enterprise Browser.

### Include all JS API modules
To include all JS APIs, you must copy the ebapi-modules.js file to a location accessible by your app's files and include the JavaScript file in your app. For instance, to include the modules file in your index.html, with the file in the same directory as your index.html, you would add the following line to the <head> section of your index.html:

    :::html
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi-modules.js"></script>

> Note: that the pathing for this file is relative to the current page.

This will define the EB class within the page. Any page you need to use the modules will need to have the .js file included in this fashion.

### Include only the modules you need
To include single APIs, you must first include the `ebapi.js` in your HTML as well as the API file you want to use. For instance, to use the Signature API, I would add the following code to my HTML file(s), assuming the API files have been copied to the same directory as the HTML.

    :::html
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ebapi.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="eb.signature.js"></script>

The ebapi.js file is necessary for all single API inclusions.
        


##Methods



### capture()
Captures the in-line signature area as an image. This function works with a non-modal signature capture area shown inside browser window. All in-line signature capture functions (like this) do not has affect the capture area shown in takeFullScreen (modal full screen capture area).

####Parameters
<ul><li>callback : <span class='text-info'>CallBackHandler</span></li></ul>

####Callback
Async Callback Returning Parameters: <span class='text-info'>HASH</span></p><ul><ul><li>status : <span class='text-info'>STRING</span><p>Whether a signature was captured or the signature capture area was dismissed (Fullscreen version only). Possible values:'ok' or 'cancel' </p></li><li>imageUri : <span class='text-info'>STRING</span><p>If the outputFormat is "image", this will be the URI of the captured signature image. If the outputFormat is "dataUri", this will be the DataURI representation of the captured signature image. </p></li><li>signature_uri : <span class='text-info'>STRING</span><p>If the outputFormat is "image", this will be the URI of the captured signature image. If the outputFormat is "dataUri", this will be the DataURI representation of the captured signature image. </p></li></ul></ul>

Hides an in-line capture area from view. It clears the inputed signature for in-line signature areas. In a hidden state, a user cannot interact with the signature capture area. This function work with non-modal signature capture area showed inside browser window. All in-line signature capture functions (like this) do not has affect to capture area showed in takeFullScreen (modal full screen capture area)

### setVectorCallback()
Signature data is formatted into a series of vectors and returned to the application via this callback function. The received data may not represent the entire signature as the vectors will be sent in batches if the signature is large. A single vector (array entry) contains an X, Y coordinate and the beginning / end of the signature is defined by (65535, 65535). This callback is independent of the callback of the capture method, when specified the callback will be called whenever a 'pen up' occurs in the signature box.

### takeFullScreen(<span class="text-info">HASH</span> propertyMap)
Shows a modal window with signature capture area and UI (toolbar with buttons) for cancel / capture and return to main application window. The callback is fired when the signature window is closed (when in full-screen) or when capture is called. On WM/CE, the signature area has visible buttons for 'clear', 'capture' and 'cancel'. On Android, the signature area has images which will behave as buttons for 'clear', 'capture' and 'cancel'. This function opens a modal full screen window therefore, other functions related to in-line signature capture (work with inside browser window area) do not affect the capture window shown by this function.

##Remarks



###Fullscreen and In-line
The signature capture feature can work in two visual modes, Full-screen and In-line. The full-screen variant has buttons to capture, clear and cancel the signature capture box, so the methods: "clear", "hide", "capture" don't need to be used. Whereas with the in-line signature capture, there are no such buttons so these will have to be designed into the app itself.

###Parameters which clear the signature
The signature capture area is designed to be set up prior to capturing the signature, as such the following parameters will clear any current signature: "width", "height", "penColor", "bgColor".

###Page Navigation
In Android, the state of the signature will not be cleared on page navigation whereas in Windows, the state of the signature is cleared.

###Persistent Behavior
While using "takeFullScreen" method, if we press Home button and re-launch the application the state won't be persisted in Android platform.
